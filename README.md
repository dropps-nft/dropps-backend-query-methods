# Backend helper methods for parsing the blockchain 

## Installation

Use the npm to install foobar.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
Go to setup.js and set whatever block you want to start querying from there. It overwrites previous records so be careful

Also, you need to create a env file and set your own database info to it 
```bash
nodemon --experimental-json-modules indexbackup.js
```
